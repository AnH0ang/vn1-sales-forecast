- [ ] Use mlforecast instead of custom model
- [ ] Check bias of model (does it really predict the mean, is it unbiased)
- [ ] Remove Inventory data
- [ ] Calculate score on sparse and dense time series separately
- [ ] make backtesting consistent
- [ ] Show live prediction in dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard worst and best predictions
- [ ] Performance by horizon
- [ ] Replace "feat:" with "feat_"
- [ ] Change CV Settings to more recent data
- [ ] (Price Null -> Zero Sales) -> Encode that into the model
- [x] Stacking of predictions with tsfeatures
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Target scaling
- [ ] Holiday Effects (number of freed days, Chrismas day, black friday, etc)
- [ ] Dashboard to inspect features
- [x] Fancy features like trend etc
- [ ] Features engineering from past M4 winners
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters
    - [ ] LGBM
    - [ ] NN
- [x] Static Ensemble of Models (0.9 * LGBM + 0.1 LGBM Median)
- [ ] Bring inventory into play
- [x] !! Fix missing cutoff_date in cv_scores
    - because of inventory filter
- [x] LGBM median forecast
- [x] TimeGPT as model
    - Does not work on mac m1
- [ ] Exogenouse variables for NN models
- [ ] Use same training loop in cv and live pred to reduce errors
- [ ] Error Analysis
- [ ] Direkt Forecast is implemented incorrectly in mlforecast  
    - static features from start date are used and not from the forecast date
- [ ] Elite model
